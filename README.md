# noteApp
Is a very simple webapp -> to recap some thing from FAC
Adds notes to a database and retreives all the notes from the database on the page..

Goals -> TDD && 100% test coverage


##WHY?
The main reason to build it was to recap some of the skills learned during FAC and to go through some of the stuff that I haven't worked on that much, for example databases. 


##HOW?
* TDD -> Test Driven development -> Using: Tape for testing 

* Istanbul to track test coverage

* Hapi JS 

* Mongo Database (MongoLab)

* Handlebars for rendering data from DB

* Deployment to Heroku 


###What next?

* [] Authentication
* [] Delete notes
* [] Edit notes
* [] Styling
